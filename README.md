# Nonparametric Derivative Estimation with Weighted Difference Quotients

This repository contains code for my preliminary exam, which implements the methodology introduced in the following paper.
- Paper reference: **Yu Liu and Kris De Brabanter**. [Smoothed Nonparametric Derivative Estimation using
Weighted Difference Quotients](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume21/19-246/19-246.pdf). _Journal of Machine Learning Research_, 21(1): 2438-2482, 2020.
- We provide both Python3 and R implementation of the proposed derivative estimation method.
